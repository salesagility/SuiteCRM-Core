1. Download the latest release of SuiteCRM from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/salesagility/SuiteCRM/releases).
2. Unzip the downloaded file into your desired directory on the server.
3. Set the correct file permissions to ensure your web server can access the SuiteCRM files:
    - Use `chown` and `chmod` commands to set ownership and permissions appropriately.
4. Access the installation wizard by navigating to your server’s address (e.g., `http://localhost/suitecrm`) in your browser.

**Troubleshooting Tips:**
- If you encounter permission issues during installation, verify the web server has access rights to the SuiteCRM files.
